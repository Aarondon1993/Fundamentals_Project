# Fundamentals Project- Simple linear Regression
## Aaron Donnelly- G00299531
***
## This README.md will sumarize the contents of the Linear Regression Jupyter Notebook contained in this repository.
***
## 1- Introduction

### The introduction introduces the data analysis method of simple linear regression and gives a detailed example of an area where simple linear regression is very useful in the pharmaceutical industry.
***
## 2- Simple Linear Regression

### This section contains the code used to perform simple linear regression on the dataset related to wind turbine power vs speed provided by Ian Mcloughlin. Scikit-learn, Matplotlib and Pandas are the three libraries used in this analysis [1][2][3][4].
***
## 3- Using Polynomial Regression

### This section contains the analysis of the same dataset using a polynomial tranformation on the x-axis to achieve a higher R^2 value. Matplotlib is again used to visualise the new regression line to show the better fit on the dataset [5].
***
## 4- Other types of regression

### This section briefly looks at other types of regression. These types are Logistical Regression, Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression [6][7].
***
## 5- Conclusion

### This section makes conclusions from the completed data analysis. After applying both the simple linear regression and the polynomial regression it can be concluded that the polynomial regression technique yeilds the better fit with a higher R^2 value also.
